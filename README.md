# 'REDUX CITIES'

A React-Native & Redux app that shows a chronological list of the cities I have lived in.

## Demonstration

## Skills & Competencies Demonstrated

* React-Native project creation and setup
* Proper use of React components and state, including the ListView.
   * The ListView only renders items in a list that are visible on the user's screen (notice how images render as the user scrolls)
* Use of Redux to generate state based on requests (actions) and conditions (reducers)
* Basic animations

## How To View

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install react-native.
3. Install the repo-specific dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Run the app in an emulator with `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios`.  Be sure to reference the [React-Native ReadMe](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/README.md) for information on this process.
