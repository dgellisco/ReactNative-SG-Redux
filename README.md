## Skills & Competencies Demonstrated

* React-Native project creation and setup
* Use of React components and state
* Use of React-Native components, including the dynamic ListView (which only renders items in the user's view - notice how images render as the user scrolls)
* Use of Redux to manage state through specific actions and reducers
* Basic React-Native animation

## How To View

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install react-native.
3. Install the repo-specific dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Run the app in an emulator with `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios`.  Be sure to reference the [React-Native ReadMe](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/README.md) for information on this process.
